# Reviving India's Rich History: Bringing Ancient Landmarks to Life
India is a country with a rich cultural and historical heritage, with numerous ancient landmarks that represent the country's past glory. However, many of these landmarks are not well known. This project aims to bring light to all the historical landmarks you may, or may not know about.
## Problem Statement
 India is a country with a rich and diverse history, and is home to several ancient landmarks that showcase its rich cultural heritage. However, many of these landmarks are in a state of disrepair, and are not accessible to the general public. In order to revive India's rich history and bring these ancient landmarks to life, there is a need for a system that can:
1. Identify ancient landmarks and gather information about their historical significance.
2. Assess the condition of these landmarks and determine what needs to be done to restore them.
3. Create a platform for public engagement and awareness, enabling people to learn about India's rich history and cultural heritage.
4. Provide accessibility to these landmarks, making them available to the general public.
